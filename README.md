Example of fighting kuka robots. The program has loaded 4 ChainVectors (projects), each containing 8 Segments (joints). 
That brings this example with 32 controlled axis. It's nothing special. Just build up your program dynamicly.

The ammount of controlled axis is dynamic. Can be rotational, translational.
It doens't matter. Thanks to the KDL coronos inverse kinematics and the OpenCascade libs !

Have fun.
